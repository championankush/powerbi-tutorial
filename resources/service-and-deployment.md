# PowerBI Service & Deployment Best Practices ☁️

## Introduction

PowerBI Service is the cloud platform for sharing, collaborating, and deploying PowerBI content. This guide covers deployment pipelines, sharing, publishing, and collaboration best practices.

## 1. PowerBI Service Overview
- **Workspaces**: Containers for dashboards, reports, datasets
- **Apps**: Packaged content for distribution
- **Datasets**: Centralized data models
- **Dataflows**: Reusable ETL pipelines

## 2. Deployment Pipelines
- **Development → Test → Production**
- Create deployment pipeline in PowerBI Service
- Assign workspaces to each stage
- Deploy content between stages with validation
- Use rules for parameterization (e.g., different data sources)

## 3. Publishing Reports
- Publish from PowerBI Desktop to Service
- Set dataset refresh schedules
- Configure data gateways for on-premises sources
- Use version control for PBIX files

## 4. Sharing & Collaboration
- Share reports/dashboards with users or groups
- Publish apps for broad distribution
- Use comments and @mentions for collaboration
- Control sharing permissions (internal/external)

## 5. Data Refresh & Gateways
- Schedule refreshes (daily, hourly, custom)
- Use On-premises Data Gateway for local sources
- Monitor refresh status and failures

## 6. Best Practices
- Use deployment pipelines for change management
- Separate dev/test/prod environments
- Document publishing and refresh processes
- Use naming conventions for workspaces and datasets
- Monitor usage and performance in Service
