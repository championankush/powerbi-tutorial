```dax
// Conversion Rate
Conversion Rate = DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(FILTER(Leads, Leads[Converted] = TRUE())),
    COUNTROWS(Leads), 0)

// Cost per Lead
Cost per Lead = DIVIDE(
    SUM(Costs[Amount]),
    COUNTROWS(Leads), 0)

// Campaign ROI
Campaign ROI = DIVIDE(
    SUM(Conversions[Value]) - SUM(Costs[Amount]),
    SUM(Costs[Amount]), 0)

// Channel Effectiveness
Channel Effectiveness = RANKX(
    ALL(Channels),
    [Conversion Rate],, DESC)
```
